This a currently still a fairly buggy poc.

TODO:

- Player should be at the bottom
- Valid moves may be treated as invalid
- Update graphics
- Add info about game actions and display the ending state
- `The Chess-Bot (pleco lib) made unexpected invalid move according to the "chess" lib` can get triggered
